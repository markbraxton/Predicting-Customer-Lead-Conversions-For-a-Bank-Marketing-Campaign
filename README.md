Predicting the Eligibility of Bank Customer for a Loan Using Random Forest Modeling

The online education market will be worth $286.62 billion by 2023 with a compound annual growth rate of 10.26% from 2018 to 2023. The goal of was to analyze and build a machine learning model to identify which leads would be converted to a customer from company data, to find relevant factors to lead the conversion process, and create a profile of the converted leads. I built a random forest model to classify the three most important factors that converted a lead to a customer out of the 16 total dimensions from the data set. The three most relevant features needed were Time Spent on Website, First Interaction being the Website, and Medium/Completed Online Profile. The accuracy and recall of the random forest classifier were 0.80 and 0.84 respectively.
