I built a random forest model to classify the three most important factors that converted a lead to a customer out of the 16 total dimensions from the data set. The three most relevant features needed were Time Spent on Website, First Interaction being the Website, and Medium/Completed Online Profile. The accuracy and recall of the random forest classifier were 0.80 and 0.84 respectively.
